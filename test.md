Corry Tendeloo (3 September 1897 – 18 October 1956) was a Dutch lawyer, feminist and politician who sat in the House of Representatives for the Free-thinking Democratic League (VDB) from 1945 until 1946, and then for the Labour Party until her death in 1956. Born in the Dutch East Indies, Tendeloo studied law at Utrecht University, during which time she made contact with people within the women's rights movement. In 1945, Tendeloo was appointed a member of the House of Representatives for the VDB in the national emergency parliament, formed to rebuild the country after World War II and organise elections. In 1948, she helped secure universal suffrage for the Dutch colonies of Suriname and Curaçao. In 1955, she put forward a motion to abolish the ban on state employment for married women. The next year she was instrumental in introducing legislation that would start to end couverture, a 19th-century law that labelled married women as incompetent to act on their own behalf.
